App.jsx

It is the main component of a currency conversion application that allows the user to convert an amount from one currency to another. The component imports the useState hook from React, as well as the InputBox component from a local file and the useCurrencyInfo hook from another local file.

The component defines several state variables using the useState hook, including amount, from, to, and convertedAmount. The amount state variable represents the amount of currency to convert, while from and to represent the currencies to convert from and to, respectively. The convertedAmount state variable represents the converted amount of currency.

The component uses the useCurrencyInfo hook to get information about the currency to convert from. It then uses the Object.keys method to get an array of currency options based on the information returned by the hook.

The component defines two functions, swap and convert. The swap function swaps the from and to currencies and updates the amount and convertedAmount state variables accordingly. The convert function calculates the converted amount of currency based on the amount and to state variables and updates the convertedAmount state variable.

The component renders a form with two InputBox components, one for the from currency and one for the to currency. The from InputBox component allows the user to enter the amount of currency to convert and select the currency to convert from, while the to InputBox component displays the converted amount of currency and allows the user to select the currency to convert to. The swap button allows the user to swap the from and to currencies, while the Convert button submits the form and calls the convert function.

To improve the code, the useCurrencyInfo hook could be refactored to use a more descriptive name, such as useCurrencyRates, to make it more clear what it does. Additionally, the InputBox component could be refactored to use more descriptive prop names, such as fromCurrency and toCurrency, to make it more clear what each prop represents. Finally, the swap and convert functions could be extracted into their own files and imported as needed to make the code more modular and easier to test.


InputBox.jsx

 It is a reusable component that can be used to render an input box with a label and a dropdown select for currency type. The component takes several props, including label, amount, onAmountChange, onCurrencyChange, currencyOptions, selectCurrency, amountDisable, currencyDisable, and className.

The useId hook from React is used to generate a unique ID for the input element, which is used to associate the label with the input element. The handleChange function is called whenever the user types in the input box, and it removes any leading zeros from the input amount before calling the onAmountChange function, if it is provided.

The component is rendered as a div element with a white background, rounded corners, and a small font size. The className prop can be used to add additional CSS classes to the component. The component is divided into two halves, with the input box on the left and the currency select on the right. The label for the input box is displayed above the input element, and the label for the currency select is displayed to the left of the select element.

The input element has a transparent background and no border, and it is disabled if the amountDisable prop is set to true. The value of the input element is set to the amount prop, which is passed in from the parent component. The onChange event is handled by the handleChange function.

The currency select element is disabled if the currencyDisable prop is set to true. The value of the select element is set to the selectCurrency prop, which is also passed in from the parent component. The onChange event is handled by an anonymous function that calls the onCurrencyChange function, if it is provided, with the new currency value.

To improve the readability of the code, the className prop could be renamed to additionalClasses to make it more clear what it is used for. Additionally, the handleChange function could be extracted into its own function outside of the component to make the code more modular and easier to test. Finally, the currencyOptions prop could be validated to ensure that it is an array of valid currency types.
